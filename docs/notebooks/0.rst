1: Classifying based off the USDA Definition
============================================

   To qualify as a “low-access community,” at least 500 people and/or at
   least 33 percent of the census tract’s population must reside more
   than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store.

   low access

Initial Model
-------------

   We determined that the best initial model for the USDA definition of
   food desert would be >=33% of the tract living more than a mile from
   a grocery store. However, all possible models will be included for
   further analysis.

.. code:: ipython3

    dataset['USDA Model Percent'] = thirty_three_percent_bool[0]
    dataset['USDA Model Count'] = five_hundred_bool[0]
    dataset['USDA Model And'] = and_mask
    dataset['USDA Model Or'] = or_mask

Save the new data
-----------------

.. code:: ipython3

    dataset.to_pickle(Path.joinpath(project_dir, "data/processed/0_data.pickle"))

Add variables to Data Dictionary
--------------------------------

.. code:: ipython3

    data_dictionary = data_dictionary.append([
        {"Variable Code":"USDA Model Percent",
        "Variable Name":"33% of the population or more with low access"},
        {"Variable Code":"USDA Model Count",
        "Variable Name":"500 people or more with low access"},
        {"Variable Code":"USDA Model And",
        "Variable Name":"Both 500 people or more and 33% of the population or more with low access"},
        {"Variable Code":"USDA Model Or",
        "Variable Name":"Either 500 people or more or 33% of the population or more with low access"}],
        ignore_index=True)
